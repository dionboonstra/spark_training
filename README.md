# spark_training

This repository contains the material for the spark training sessions, in particular:

1. The slides (under *presentations*)
2. The databricks notebooks

For the spark trainings, it is important to have an active subscription with azure, that you will use to create resources/load data into resources/process the data. If you don't already have an azure subscription that you want to use, you should create one using one of these steps:

1. Create an azure for students account with your HVA email (preferred). See https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/ for how to create an azure account.
2. Create a free azure account using your HVA email. See https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/
3. In case you cannot do the above (because you already have an azure account on your hva email for some reason), then create a disposable email (e.g. an hotmail email, see https://outlook.live.com/) and use that to register on azure at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/

Once you create your azure subscription, you should visit https://portal.azure.com and login with your email and the password you chose when you created the account. After you login, you should get a welcome message and after that, you will se the main screen of the portal, which will look something like this:
