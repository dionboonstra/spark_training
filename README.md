# spark_training

This repository contains the material for the spark training sessions, in particular:

1. The slides (under *presentations*)
2. The databricks notebooks

For the spark trainings, it is important to have an active subscription with azure, that you will use to create resources/load data into resources/process the data. If you don't already have an azure subscription that you want to use, you should create one using one of these steps:

2. Create a free azure account using your HVA email. See https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/
2. In case you cannot do the above (because you already have an azure account on your hva email for some reason), then create a disposable email (e.g. an hotmail email, see https://outlook.live.com/) and use that to register on azure at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/

**UPDATE: do not use the azure for students subscription (see https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/). Unfortunately, it turns out this subscription does not allow you to create databricks clusters because the quota limits for it are too low.** So use the free account (with the HVA email or with a disposable email) instead.

Once you create your azure subscription, you should visit https://portal.azure.com and login with your email and the password you chose when you created the account. After you login, you should get a welcome message and after that, you will se the main screen of the portal, which will look something like this:

On the upper left of the screen, you can use the hamburger button to open the navigation tab. If you click on 'cost management and billing', you will see the details of your subscription. If you use method 1 above to create an azure account, it will say 'azure for students' under subscriptions once you click on the billing tab:

Once you do this, you are good to go for the spark sessions.
