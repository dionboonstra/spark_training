# spark_training

This repository contains the material for the spark training sessions, in particular:

1. The slides (under *presentations*)
2. The databricks notebooks

For the spark trainings, it is important to have an active subscription with azure, that you will use to create resources/load data into resources/process the data. If you don't already have an azure subscription that you want to use, you should create one using one of these steps:

1. Create an azure for students account with your HVA email (preferred). See https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/ for how to create an azure account.
2. Create a free azure account using your HVA email. See https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/
3. In case you cannot do the above (because you already have an azure account on your hva email for some reason), then create a disposable email (e.g. an hotmail email, see https://outlook.live.com/) and use that to register on azure at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/

Once you create your azure subscription, you should visit https://portal.azure.com and login with your email and the password you chose when you created the account. After you login, you should get a welcome message and after that, you will se the main screen of the portal, which will look something like this:

On the upper left of the screen, you can use the hamburger button to open the navigation tab. If you click on 'cost management and billing', you will see the details of your subscription. If you use method 1 above, it will say 'azure for students':

Once you do this, you are good to go for the spark sessions.
